## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- A GoDaddy hosting account (Linux hosting with cPanel)
- Domain name registered (on GoDaddy or pointing to GoDaddy)
- Node.js installed locally (v18 or higher)
- Git installed on your local machine
- SSH client (PuTTY for Windows, Terminal for Mac/Linux)
- FTP client (FileZilla) - optional but recommended

---

## GoDaddy Setup

### Step 1: Access Your GoDaddy cPanel

1. Log in to [GoDaddy.com](https://www.godaddy.com)
2. Click on "My Products"
3. Find your hosting plan and click "Manage"
4. Scroll down and click "cPanel Login" or "Open cPanel"
5. Log in with your hosting credentials

### Step 2: Check Node.js/npm Availability

1. In cPanel, look for "EasyApache 4" or "MultiPHP Manager"
2. Verify that Node.js is installed
3. If not available, contact GoDaddy support to enable Node.js hosting on your account
4. Alternative: Use GoDaddy's Managed WordPress or App Hosting if standard hosting doesn't support Node.js

**Note:** If GoDaddy doesn't support Node.js, use one of these alternatives:
- **GoDaddy App Hosting** (supports Node.js apps)
- **Vercel Deployment** (free, recommended for Next.js)
- **Netlify** (free, great for Next.js)

## Prepare Your Project

### Step 1: Build the Production Version

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/tei-website

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Step 2: Create Production Files

```bash
# Ensure you have:
# - .next folder (generated by build)
# - public folder
# - package.json
# - package-lock.json
# - node_modules folder (created by npm install)
```

### Step 3: Prepare for Compression

```bash
# Create a zip file of your project
# Include: .next, public, package.json, package-lock.json, node_modules

# On Mac/Linux:
zip -r tei-website.zip .next public package.json package-lock.json node_modules

# On Windows:
# Right-click folder > Send to > Compressed (zipped) folder
```

## Deploy to GoDaddy

### Method 1: Using File Manager (Recommended for Beginners)

#### Step 1: Upload Your Project

1. In cPanel, click "File Manager"
2. Navigate to `public_html` folder (this is your website root)
3. **Important:** Back up existing files first (create a backup folder)
4. Delete or move old files if necessary
5. Click "Upload" and select your `tei-website.zip` file
6. Once uploaded, right-click the zip file and select "Extract"
7. Move the extracted files to the `public_html` root

#### Step 2: Configure Node.js

1. In cPanel, find "Node.js Manager" or "App Manager"
2. Click "Create Application"
3. Set Application Root: `/home/yourusername/public_html`
4. Set Application URL: Your domain name
5. Select Node.js version: 18 or higher
6. Click "Create"

#### Step 3: Set Up Package.json Start Script

Ensure your `package.json` has the correct start script:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start -p 8080",
    "dev": "next dev"
  }
}
```

### Method 2: Using SSH/Terminal (Advanced)

#### Step 1: Connect via SSH

```bash
# On Mac/Linux Terminal or Windows PowerShell
ssh username@yourdomain.com
# Or: ssh -l username yourdomain.com
# Enter your password when prompted
```

#### Step 2: Navigate and Upload

```bash
# Go to public_html
cd public_html

# Download your project (if not already uploaded)
wget https://github.com/yourusername/tei-website/archive/main.zip
# Or use SCP to upload from your local machine

# Extract if needed
unzip main.zip
cd tei-website
```

#### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install npm packages
npm install

# Build production version
npm run build
```

#### Step 4: Start the Application

```bash
# Start the Node.js app on port 8080
npm start &

# Or use PM2 for process management
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start npm --name "tei-website" -- start
pm2 startup
pm2 save
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Step 1: Verify the Website is Running

1. Open your browser
2. Go to `https://yourdomain.com`
3. Check that:
   - Homepage loads without errors
   - Images display correctly
   - Navigation links work
   - Responsive design works on mobile

### Step 2: Test Admin Panel

1. Navigate to `https://yourdomain.com/admin/login`
2. Log in with default credentials:
   - Email: `admin@tei.com`
   - Password: `admin123`
3. Test adding a product and verify it appears on the frontend
4. Test contact form and verify messages appear in admin panel
5. Test quote requests

### Step 3: Check Browser Console

1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Check Console tab for any errors
3. Check Network tab to ensure all assets load
4. Test localStorage by going to Application > Local Storage

### Step 4: Test on Different Devices

- Mobile devices (test responsive design)
- Tablets
- Different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Database & Storage Notes

### Data Persistence

This application uses **localStorage** for data persistence, which means:

**Pros:**
- No database setup required
- Data persists on each user's browser
- Works immediately after deployment
- Free hosting compatible

**Cons:**
- Data is browser-specific (different computers see different data)
- Data is lost if browser cache is cleared
- Not suitable for multi-user environments

### To Upgrade to a Real Database (Future)

If you need data to be shared across all users, upgrade to:
- **Supabase** (PostgreSQL backend) - Free tier available
- **MongoDB** (NoSQL) - Free tier available
- **Firebase** (Google's solution)

**Steps to integrate:**
1. Sign up for the database service
2. Update `lib/store.tsx` to use API calls instead of localStorage
3. Create API routes in `/app/api/` folder
4. Re-deploy

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cannot GET /"

**Solution:**
- Check that `.next` folder exists in `public_html`
- Verify `package.json` exists and has correct start script
- Restart the Node.js application in cPanel

### Issue: 404 Error on Routes

**Solution:**
- Next.js routing may not work with standard cPanel
- Ensure `.htaccess` file is configured for SPA routing
- Check GoDaddy support for App Hosting alternative

### Issue: Images Not Loading

**Solution:**
- Verify images are in the `public` folder
- Check image paths in code (should be `/image-name.jpg`)
- Ensure public folder was uploaded correctly
- Check file permissions (should be readable)

### Issue: Slow Loading Performance

**Solution:**
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Verify Node.js app is running in cPanel
- Check if hosting account has enough resources
- Consider upgrading to higher tier hosting

### Issue: Database Data Lost After Refresh

**Solution:**
- This is expected with localStorage
- Data is specific to each browser's local storage
- To see data from a different device, you need a real database
- Follow "Upgrade to a Real Database" section above

### Issue: HTTPS Not Working

**Solution:**
- cPanel usually includes free SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt)
- In cPanel, go to "Manage SSL Certificates"
- Ensure "AutoSSL" is enabled
- Force HTTPS by adding to code or `.htaccess`

### Issue: Admin Credentials Not Working

**Solution:**
- Default credentials are hardcoded
- To change, edit `lib/auth-context.tsx`
- Change the `defaultAdminCredentials` object
- Clear browser localStorage and try again

---

## Important Security Notes

### Before Going Live:

1. **Change Admin Credentials:**
   - Edit `/lib/auth-context.tsx`
   - Update `defaultAdminCredentials`

2. **Add Environment Variables** (if upgrading to real database):
   - In cPanel, set environment variables
   - Create `.env.local` file with sensitive data
   - Never commit `.env.local` to Git

3. **Enable HTTPS:**
   - Use Let's Encrypt (usually free with cPanel)
   - Update all links to use `https://`

4. **Backup Your Data:**
   - Regularly backup your website files via cPanel
   - Export product/quote data regularly
   - Use cPanel's auto-backup feature

5. **Set File Permissions:**
   - `public_html`: 755
   - Files inside: 644
   - `.htaccess` and config files: 644

---

## Performance Optimization

### Step 1: Enable Caching

In cPanel:
1. Go to "Zone Editor"
2. Set appropriate cache levels
3. Enable browser caching

### Step 2: Optimize Images

Before uploading images:
- Compress images to reduce file size
- Use modern formats (WebP)
- Use responsive image sizes

### Step 3: Enable Gzip Compression

In cPanel:
1. Go to "Gzip Compression"
2. Enable compression
3. This can reduce file sizes by 60-80%

---

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Regular Tasks:

1. **Weekly:**
   - Check website loads correctly
   - Verify admin panel works
   - Monitor error logs

2. **Monthly:**
   - Backup all files
   - Review quote requests
   - Update contact information if needed

3. **Quarterly:**
   - Update Node.js version if necessary
   - Review and update security settings
   - Check hosting plan resource usage

### View Logs

In cPanel:
1. Go to "Error Log"
2. Check for any application errors
3. Fix issues as they arise
